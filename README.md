# TicTacToe AI
This repository features a TicTacToe bot using Artificial Intelligence with MiniMax algorithm.

## Usage
Simply head over to `src/tictactoe.py` and run the file. You will be able to play TicTacToe against the AI.

## How does the AI work?
The AI works by recursively evaluating the game tree of the current state of the game, and assigning a score to each possible move. The algorithm will then choose the move with the highest score, assuming that the opponent will also make the best move possible. The algorithm will then repeat this process until the game is over.
